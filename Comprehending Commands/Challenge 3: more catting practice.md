# Challenge 3: more catting practice
Using `cat` to read the contents of a file in a given directory
## Solution
Invoke the `cat` command with the given _absolute_ path as an argument to read the contents of the file without `cd`'ing into the directory
```
You cannot use the 'cd' command in this level, and must retrieve the flag by
absolute path. Plus, I hid the flag in a different directory! You can find it
in the file /lib/jvm/java-1.11.0-openjdk-amd64/flag. Go cat it out **without**
cding into that directory!
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ cat /lib/jvm/java-1.11.0-openjdk-amd64/flag
pwn.college{gvZpOKZ_igniWNRnUIgW3kPbhiy.QXwITO0wiMwAzNzEzW}
```

## Flag
`pwn.college{gvZpOKZ_igniWNRnUIgW3kPbhiy.QXwITO0wiMwAzNzEzW}`
