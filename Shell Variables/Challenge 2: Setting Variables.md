# Challenge 2: Setting Variables
Assigning values to _shell variables_
## Solution
Set the value of `PWN` to `COLLEGE` by using `=`
```
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{gfg57uWzbVn7v9QytsKLI12pyKV.QX5UTN0wiMwAzNzEzW}
```
## Flag
`pwn.college{gfg57uWzbVn7v9QytsKLI12pyKV.QX5UTN0wiMwAzNzEzW}`
### Notes
- learnt about the `=` operator, which can assign values to variables 
- the `$` prefix is only used to _access_ variables
