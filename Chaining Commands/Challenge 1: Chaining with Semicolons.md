# Challenge 1: Chaining with Semicolons

## Solution
Invoke `/challenge/pwn` and `/challenge/college` and use a `;` to 
```
hacker@chaining~chaining-with-semicolons:~$ /challenge/pwn;/challenge/college
Yes! You chained /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{4I5YmH4lQlW6_nKhs7IQpp-fUnf.QX1UDO0wiMwAzNzEzW}
```
## Flag
`pwn.college{4I5YmH4lQlW6_nKhs7IQpp-fUnf.QX1UDO0wiMwAzNzEzW}`
